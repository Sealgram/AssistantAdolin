My Grade 11 final project, a virtual assistant named Adolin.
Im pretty sure this program would only work on a mac, more specifiacally my mac (some stuff may work on another, some may not, depending on the programs installed.) If you can figure out a way to get the equivalent of all my brew installs onto a windows computer you may have some functionality, but the opening programs functionality is based on paths from a Mac, so that would cause errors on windows (or just have Adolin repeatedly telling you he cannot open that program).

## To Run This Code:
```bash
brew install portaudio
brew install espeak
brew install swig
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install PyAudio
pip install webbrowser
pip install pocketsphinx
```
